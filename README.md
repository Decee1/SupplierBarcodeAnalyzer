# Barcode scanner

Scan Digikey component bags and return product information. Uses Python3. Works for 2D data matrix QR codes and 1D barcodes.

- barcode_api.py handles all the API calls and refresh tokens (when necessary).
- barcode_scan.py is an example using a webcam. There are lots of debug messages to help others troubleshoot their own scripts.

Some setup required. See ðŸ‘‡ for a guide setting up a Digikey API account.
