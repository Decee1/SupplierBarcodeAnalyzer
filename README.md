# Barcode scanner

Scan electrical component bags (Digikey, Mouser, and LCSC) and return product information. Uses Python3. Works for 2D DataMatrix,  QR, and 1D barcodes.

- ![barcode_api.py](/barcode_api.py) handles all the API calls and refresh tokens (when necessary).
- ![barcode_scan.py](/barcode_scan.py) is an example using a webcam. There are lots of debug messages to help others troubleshoot their own scripts.

Some setup required. See üëá for a guide setting up a Digikey/Mouser API and running the python script.

# Supplier Barcodes

- [ ] Digikey: DK provides a fully functional barcode API for product and invoice info. üëç good job DK!
   - ‚úî 2D: specific API exists for invoice and product info queries. QR code is data matrix format.<br>Always starts with `[)>`
   - ‚úî 1D: specific API exists for invoice and product info queries. QR code is data matrix format.
- [ ] Mouser: There's a part number query API, but no native barcode searching. 
   - ‚úî 2D: PN is extracted from DataMatrix (always starts with `>[)>`) and searched using Mouser's API
   - ‚ûñ 1D: Script can read the barcodes, but currently has no way of telling which barcode value correlates to which property because there are seperate 1D barcodes for `Cust PO`, `Line Items`, `Mouser P/N`, `MFG P/N`, `QTY`, `COO`, and `Invoice No`.
- [ ]  LCSC: No API. 
   - ‚ûñ 2D: Some of my LCSC bags have QR barcodes (1 in 10 I'd guess). The QR code contains: `productCode`, `orderNo`, `pickerNo`,`pickTime`, and `checkCode`. So far all the tool can do is search LCSC for the PN but the user needs to navigate the page and extract the info. Need to write a javascript web scraper. 
   - ‚ùå 1D: String ~10 characters in length. Can't extract anything useful from these.
